# Bars.Mvvm.FluidApi.WPF

This project provided pre-generated code for the fluid API to simplify the creation of Actipro WPF Bars in MVVM for those who for some reason cannot or want to use the source generator in the project, or as a fallback if the source generator fails to generate the code.

The downside of this approach is that you will have to update the NuGet package every time Actipro adds new properties to their ViewModels (and a new release of this package is available), which is why I recommend using the source generator instead.
