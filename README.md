# Bars.Mvvm
# Fluid API for Actipro WPF Bars
The goal of this project is to extend ActiproSoftware's [WPF-Library](https://github.com/Actipro/WPF-Controls) to offer a more simplified implementation of [bar menus](https://www.actiprosoftware.com/products/controls/wpf/bars) through MVVM.

* **[Fluent API](./Source/FluidApi.Generator/README.md)**: The fluid API allows you to create bar menus in a more declarative way, making it easier to read and maintain. 
* **[DataTemplate selector generator](./Source/TemplateSelector.Wpf.Generator/README.md)**: reduces the need to manually create `ComponentResourceKey` and map to the properties of `DataTemplateSelector` or `ItemContainerTemplateSelector`.
