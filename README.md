# Bars.Mvvm.FluidGenerator

The goal of this project is to add Fluid API to ActiproSoftware's [WPF-Library](https://github.com/Actipro/WPF-Controls) to offer fluid syntax for building MVVM [bar menus](https://www.actiprosoftware.com/products/controls/wpf/bars).

The fluid API is available as a incremental Source Generator to reduce the need to upgrade to a new package every time Actipro adds new properties to their ViewModels and then having to wait for a new version of the Fluid API NuGet package to get full support.

## Getting Started
1. Install the NuGet package `Bars.Mvvm.FluidGenerator` in your project.
